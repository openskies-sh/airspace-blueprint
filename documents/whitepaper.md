## Introduction

The aim of this document is to develop operating parameters and performance envelope for software systems in the context of UTM / U-Space. The UTM eco-system software that includes for e.g. [DSS software](https://github.com/interuss/dss), [registry](https://github.com/openskies-sh/aircraftregistry), [identity and authentication](https://github.com/openskies-sh/flight_passport) are essentially a series of complex interconnected technologies and processes that need comprehensive testing at different levels of the stack.

## Goals

There are two major goals of this document, to develop a assessment of the security standards, hardware tests and develop data on the operational requirements for an airspace. It hopes to address the questions for policy makers around design of airspace, developing performance of de-confliction algorithms etc. At a broader level, the goal of this document is to develop an understanding of the resilince / brittleness of the airspace as it gets more active. Finally, this document hopes to develop a comprehensive software suite to test for these scenarios.

## Scenarios

To build a comprehensive testing and load simulation, we utilize the TCL program to develop scenarios. NASA has developed a series of tests under the Technology Capabiltiy Level (TCL) program to demonstrate and operationalize key enabling technologies for UTM in an increasing order of complexity. NASA has provided detailed reports about these tests and they are available on the [NASA UTM website](https://utm.arc.nasa.gov/documents.shtml). These demonstrators increase in complexity of missions and diverse stakeholders, the most important and relevant scenarios as demosntrated in the TCL tests is in TCL 3 and 4. TCL 4 specifically focuses on high-density urban operations, the most complicated scenario for a registry and we will focus on this.

### Extrapolating real world scenarios from TCL demos

The TCL tests are just a demonstration of core technical capability but can be a useful basis to extrapolate to understand potential real-world flight densities. For more information about TCL 4 reports, please reveiew the [results and analysis](https://utm.arc.nasa.gov/docs/2020-Rios_TM_220462-USS-Net-Perf.pdf) PDF. The most relevant Measures of Performance (MOP) for this document is UTM-MOP-16:

- _"Successful High Density Operations" which is define as the following “measures the number of (live and simulated) aircraft per defined 0.2nmi​2​ of UTM operations."_
- _"For this analysis, the minimum success criteria was more precisely defined as “ 10 aircraft (atleast 3 live operations) airborne and managed by UTM within an area of 0.2 nmi​2​."_
- _"The value of 0.2 nmi​2​ is roughlyequivalent to 720 m​2​ or a circle with radius 406m, For all calculations in this paper, a circle with 406m radius was used to calculate density."_
  
<br>From the document, below is a image of the study area that is 406m in density with > 10 flights.

TCL demonstrators are not meant to be a reflection of a real world "fully active" use. In addition to Reno, there were tests in the  Corpus Christi area. We can extrapolate this using data about Reno by making some assumptions.

### Broadcast Remote ID projections for the airspace

In this section, we develop projections of broadcast Remote ID messages in the airspace, the ASTM spec says that the UAS can use either Wifi or Bluetooth 4.0 or Bluetooth 5.0 to "broadcast" Remote ID information as part of WiFi Aware for e.g. advertisement messages.

### Flights and Broadcast Remote ID Bandwidth

| | |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Average flight return time (Assuming average speed of 35 km/hr and average distance of 10 km) | __34 mins__ |
| Number of broadcast Remote ID messages per flight  | __2040__ (1 per second)  |
| Minimum Mandatory fields (Basic ID Message + Location / Vector Message) | __50 bytes__ |
| Maximum data message size (uncompressed) if all fields used e.g. Authentication System Message and Operator ID | __150 bytes__ |
| Minimum bytes per return flight (35 mins @ 1 message/ sec = 2040 messages, 50 bytes / message | 2040 * 50 = **102,000 bytes** |
| Maximum bytes per return flight (35 mins @ 1 message/ sec = 2040 messages, 150 bytes / message | 2040 * 150 =**306,000 bytes** |

<br>

| Parameter | Reno, Nevada | Corpus Christi, Texas|
|---| ------------- |-------------|
| Average Flight time | 34 mins. | 30 mins. |
|Flight Frequency | 1255 flights / hour | 1633 flights / hour |
|Flights in the air | 25% capacity - 313 flights / hour <br>50% capacity - 627 flights / hour <br>75% capacity - 942 flights / hour |25% capacity -  408 flights / hour <br>50% capacity - 816 flights / hour <br>75% capacity-  1224 flights / hour |

Using this we develop a flight density and bandwidth envelope as shown below throughout the entire airspace <br>

### Broadcast Remote ID Sensor Network

Typically the range of a WiFi signal is about 125-150 ft. or 38 - 45 meters. For the sake of simplicity we assume 50 meters. A drone flying at 35 km / hour (9.7 m/s) will cover 50 meters in rougly 5.1 seconds. If we assume a mesh of WiFi receivers at 50 meters (the range of WiFi aware signal), we can estimate the number of sensors necessary to cover the entire area.

| Number of sensors to cover every 50 m | **104388** | **286329** |

### Broadcast Remote ID sensors for major highway corridoors

| Parameter | Reno, Nevada | Corpus Christi, Texas|
|---| ------------- |-------------|
| Total Length of major highways | 81.78 kms | 52.27 kms |
| Theoritical number of sensors required (every 50 m) | **1635** | **1045** |

#### Tracking error and packet loss

Assuming 50% of total flights will go over primary roads:

For the flight density and bandwidth we can estimate the flights to be tracked and sensor performance as below.
